            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>YOu may obſerve that our Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Preparations here intended, are no other than a noble and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious way of preparing of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, for the benefit of the Sick, and credit of the Phyſitian, by the Art of Diſtillation; which Art, as ſome affirm, came firſt to knowledge from the Arabians, as the firſt Inventers thereof: but as this is not very eaſie to prove, ſo
'tis not much material to our purpoſe. We ought to underſtand that the Art of Diſtillation is the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or drawing Juices, Liquors, and other
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42524:4"/> Moiſtures more ſubtile (by vertue of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent heats, as the matter may require) from moſt kinde of things. Or Diſtillation is by Art to ſeparate a running Moiſture firſt in vapors, ariſing to the head of the Still, and from thence is condenſed and turned into liquor, running into the applyed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver: or it may be termed the changing of groſs Bodies into thin and pure ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſeparating the moſt pure part from the corrupt; or the making things perfect, which are yet immature or unperfect, by which way matter or things are brought to a far greater purity, with augmentation of their Vertues. Alſo by this Art of Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, are ſeparated the pure, eſſential, ſpiritual Humidity, from the watry or fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Matter. Or in few words, by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation may (from Herbs, Flowers, Roots, Seeds, Berries, Woods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) be drawn Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, Flegms, and Oyls, and from their Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies by expreſſion a Vineger, and out of thoſe Fecies after calcination, their fixed Salt. Out of Gums and Rozins are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Spirits, Oyls, and at laſt a Balſom, or Red Oyl. In Salts, Minerals, and Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, are various preparations, too tedious here to relate, the particulars you may find in the Treatiſe. For in this Art are many,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42524:4"/> and various Conſiderations neceſſary to be learned, that is according to the matter to be diſtilled, to uſe ſeemly and proper ways whereby the Work may be brought to a happy end. Now all manner of Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be performed divers ways, and in divers Veſſels, according to the judgement and pleaſure of the Operator, yet ought he carefully to minde that way moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the guiding the Work after the beſt manner, and for that purpoſe to uſe ſuch Veſſels and Inſtruments moſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for his intended Work. As for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling of Herbs, Roots, Flowers, Leaves, Berries, for the obtaining their Spirits, Oyls, Vinegers, and Salts, there neceſſarily go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before Diſtillation, Infuſion and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.

               </head>
               <p>BEfore we Treat of Diſtillations, it is convenient to declare the manner of Luting or Defending the Veſſels from the violence of the Fire, and for the cloſure of the Joynts of the Veſſel, which many neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42524:5"/> do thereby looſe their beſt Volatile and Penetrating Spirits, and ſo their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine becomes leſs efficacious, than if care had been taken; and for the prevention of ſuch dangers, I have here at large deſcribed ſeveral ſorts of Lutes, as followeth.</p>
               <p>The beſt Lute for building of Furnaces, is made of ſifted Potters Earth; or in defect of that, good Lyme, being laid abroad: ſift into it a little fine Sand, and adding ſome Horſe-dung, mixing the ſame with Brine of Fleſh, or Salt-water, after incorporate and labour it well together with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, the more the better; and if you add the Caput Mort of Aquaſortis, firſt made ſoft by the addition of water, and mix them all well, this Clay will not crack, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main fixt in the fire. Some add filings of Iron, powdered Glaſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If equal parts of the Caput Mort of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, or Aquaſortis, be mixt with Tobacco-pipe Clay and ſome Horſe-dung, it ſerves for the Coating of Glaſſes, and ſo will the former.</p>
               <p>For the Cloſure of the Joynts of Glaſſes, you may firſt cloſe the Receivers to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torts with the aforeſaid Lute, and when dry you may ſmeer it over with a mixture made of equal parts of Red-led and Quick-lime,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42524:5"/> or Lime onely, ground well together with Lin-ſeed Oyl.</p>
               <p>Or Tobacco-pipe Clay ground, or mixt with the White of an Egg, and ſpread upon a Cloath, and ſo applyed.</p>
               <p>Or Ox-bladders dipped in the Whites of Eggs well beaten, and ſo applyed.</p>
               <p>Old Loam and the White of an Egg, mix them into a Paſte, and ſpread it upon a Cloath.</p>
               <p>Or Linnen rags dipped in the water of Whites of Eggs, and applyed to the Cracks of Glaſſes, &amp; ſo ſtrowed powdered Quick-lime upon the ſame, put in two or three one upon the other.</p>
               <p>Another Lute for broken Glaſſes is thus: Take old tough Rindes of Cheeſe, ſoak it in water all night, and then beat them up in a Paſte, and ſpread them abroad upon a board, and ſtrow upon it equal weight of Quick-lime powdered, and grinde them again; then mix them with well beaten Whites of Eggs, and make it into Paſte.</p>
